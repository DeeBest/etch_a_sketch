# etch_a_sketch
I built this project in line with The Odin Projects which is an online web development curriculum, aiming to take  one
from being a beginner to a full stack developer. Here I was tested to the limits in all front-end web development languages
(HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT). 

In this project I build a web app that is similar to the classic Etch A Sketch mechanical drawing toy. Firstly I had to
 create square divider which will be  container for the small squares that were supposed to make up a grid, the grid had to
 update every time a user put number of boxes he wants per side of the grid. I had to add event listeners so that the squares
 in my container will change their background color to black when mouse is down and moved over them.

This project was very challenging because I had to do a lot of research on some of the topics that were not covered in The 
Odin Projects curriculum but with that I gained a lot of knowledge and bettered my research skills. The most challenging part was creating the grid through JavaScript instead of CSS. Then was the issue of creating the grid based on user requirement, here
I actual had to step away from computer for few days and came back with a fresh mind. There were lot of challenges but i enjoyed
solving each of them.
